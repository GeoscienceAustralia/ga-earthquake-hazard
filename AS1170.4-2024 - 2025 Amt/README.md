# Draft Hazard-Design Factor (_Z_) Maps and Elastic Design Spectrum for the 2025 Amendment to the AS1170.4:2024

This archive provides the GIS contours for the draft 2025 Amendment to the AS1170.4:2024. A downloadable [zip file]() contains the vector contours on Esri shapefile, Google Earth and geojson format as described in _Allen, T., S. Menegon, J. Wilson, and BD-006-11 Seismic Hazard Working Group (2025). Draft Hazard-Design Factor (Z) Maps and Elastic Design Spectrum for the 2025 Amendment to the AS1170.4:2024_, presented at the Australian Earthquake Engineering Society 2025 National Conference in Melbourne, Victoria. High-resolution maps are privided in the [maps]() folder.

The contour levels represent zones where the hazard design (_Z_) factors are 0.10 g and 0.12 g for regions enveloped by the contours. A minimum threshold for the _Z_ factor applies for all regions not enveloped by these contour levels.
