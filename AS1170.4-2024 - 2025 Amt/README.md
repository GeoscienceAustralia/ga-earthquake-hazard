# Draft Hazard-Design Factor (_Z_) Maps and Elastic Design Spectrum for the 2025 Amendment to the AS1170.4:2024

This archive provides the GIS contours for the draft 2025 Amendment to the AS1170.4:2024. A downloadable [zip file](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/ga-earthquake-hazard/tree/master/AS1170.4-2024%20-%202025%20Amt/contours/AS1170_4_fitted_contours.zip) contains the vector contours on Esri shapefile, Google Earth and geojson format as described in _Allen, T., S. Menegon, J. Wilson, and BD-006-11 Seismic Hazard Working Group (2025). Draft Hazard-Design Factor (Z) Maps and Elastic Design Spectrum for the 2025 Amendment to the AS1170.4:2024_, presented at the Australian Earthquake Engineering Society 2025 National Conference in Melbourne, Victoria. High-resolution maps are privided in the [maps](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/ga-earthquake-hazard/tree/master/AS1170.4-2024%20-%202025%20Amt/maps/) folder.

The contour levels represent zones where the hazard design (_Z_) factors are 0.10 g and 0.12 g for regions enveloped by the contours, respectively. A minimum threshold for the _Z_ factor of 0.08 g applies for all regions not enveloped by these contour levels. Raw contour levels, which represent the modified probabilistic hazard in the 2023 National Seismic Hazard Assessment of Australia ([Allen _et al._, 2023]( https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/148969)) are also provided in the [contours](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/ga-earthquake-hazard/tree/master/AS1170.4-2024%20-%202025%20Amt/contours) folder.
