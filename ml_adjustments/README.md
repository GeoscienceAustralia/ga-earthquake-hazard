# A Pragmatic Approach to Adjusting Early Instrumental Local Magnitudes for Seismic Hazard Assessments in Australia

This archive provides data and codes used in the production of the manuscript "A pragmatic approach to adjusting early instrumental local magnitudes for seismic hazard assessments in Australia" by Trevor I Allen, submitted to the Journal of Seismology.  Files include:

- **NSHA18CAT_V1.0.csv:** Eartquake catalogue as used for Geoscience Australia's [2018 National Seismic Hazard Assessment](http://www.ga.gov.au/about/projects/safety/nsha). A description of the catalogue fields is provided in Appendix D of [Allen et al., 2018](https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/123041).
- **au_station_data_noarray.csv:** File containing the name and location of known Australian seismic stations.  For the sensitivity of uncertainty in the magnitude corrections, only one element of seismic arrays have been retained.
