# Exploring Australian Hazard Map Exceedance Using an Atlas of Historical ShakeMaps

This archive provides data used in the production of the manuscript "Exploring Australian Hazard Map Exceedance Using an Atlas of Historical ShakeMaps" by Trevor I Allen, Hadi Ghasemi and Jonathan D Griffin, submitted to the journal Earthquake Spectra.  Files include:

-
- **shakemap_event_list_australia.csv:** List of earthquake parameters for events within the Australian continental crust used in this study. 
- **shakemap_event_list_plate_margin.csv:** List of earthquake parameters for plate-margin events used in this study.
